          Sigstore is made up of a combination of technologies to handle signing, verification and provenance checks that
          respect privacy and work at scale. This section shows the open source subprojects that make up Sigstore as well
          as non-code projects that support the Sigstore community such as roadmap and specification.

      - subcategory: "Deployments"
        content: |
          In some cases Sigstore services are run as public instance, for example, the public instance of the Rekor transparency
          log used to verify signatures. This section allows you to discover public instances run by the community and or
          organizations who host Sigstore services.

      - subcategory: "Integrations"
        content: |
          Use of Sigstore is sometimes transparent to users as its signing and verification functionality is seamlessly integrated
          with version control or build software. This section highlights open source and closed source tools, platforms and applications
          that integrate Sigstore functionality such that users of those tools may benefit from software signing and verification.

      - subcategory: "Signed With"
        content: |
          This section highlights open source and closed source software that use Sigstore for signing artifacts. That means that users of
          these tools are able to verify the integrity of artifacts using Sigstore.

      - subcategory: "Case Studies"
        content: |
          This section showcases organizations that currently use Sigstore as part of their software supply chain security toolbox. That means
          the organizations are at a minimum signing internal artifacts with Sigstore. Each organization links to a specific case study to highlight
          how they are using Sigstore.
